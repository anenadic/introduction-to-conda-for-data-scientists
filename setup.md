## Installation Instructions

### Install Git

First you need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Instructions for installing Git depend 
(slightly!) on your operating system and can be found in the 
[Introduction to Git for (Data) Scientists](https://github.com/kaust-vislab/introduction-to-git-for-data-scientists#installation-instructions) 
repository.
