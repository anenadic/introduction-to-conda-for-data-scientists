## Installation Instructions

Installation of Conda will be covered during the lesson and no additional software installation is 
required.

## Workspace Setup

In order to maintain a consistent workspace for all learners we will create an 
`introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists` directory on the Desktop to serve as our working 
directory for the duration of the lesson. On Mac OS and Linux running following commands in the
Terminal will create the required directory on the Desktop.

~~~
$ cd ~/Desktop
$ mkdir introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists
$ cd introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists
~~~
{: .language-bash}


For Windows users you will need to reverse the direction of the slash (because Windows) and run 
the commands from the command prompt.

~~~
> cd ~\Desktop
> mkdir introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists
> cd introduction-to-conda-for-data-scientists
~~~
